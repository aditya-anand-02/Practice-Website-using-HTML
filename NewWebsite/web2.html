<p>Dvapara Yuga is the third of the four yugas, or cosmic ages, according to Hindu mythology. It follows Satya Yuga and Treta Yuga and is considered to be an age of declining righteousness and moral values. Here is some information about Dvapara Yuga:<br>

  1. Duration: Dvapara Yuga is said to last for 864,000 years, which is shorter than both Satya Yuga and Treta Yuga but longer than the subsequent Kali Yuga.<br>

  2. Moral and Spiritual Decline: As Dvapara Yuga progresses, there is a further decline in moral values and spirituality compared to the previous yugas. Human beings become more materialistic, self-centered, and driven by their desires.<br>

  3. Social Divisions and Struggles: Dvapara Yuga is characterized by the emergence of social hierarchies and increasing divisions within society. People are more inclined towards power, wealth, and social status. Conflicts and struggles for dominance become more prevalent.<br>

  4. Religious Rituals and Ceremonies: Dvapara Yuga is also known for the rise of elaborate religious rituals and ceremonies. People engage in complex religious practices, offering sacrifices and performing ceremonies with the goal of attaining spiritual growth and blessings.<br>

  5. Spiritual Practices: Although moral values decline, spiritual practices and disciplines are still followed, albeit to a lesser extent than in previous yugas. Meditation, yoga, and other spiritual practices are pursued by those seeking spiritual awakening.<br>

  6. Avatars and Divine Incarnations: According to Hindu mythology, Dvapara Yuga is marked by the appearances of divine incarnations, known as avatars, who descend to Earth to restore righteousness and guide humanity. The most well-known avatar of Dvapara Yuga is Lord Krishna, who played a central role in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata.<br>

  7. Decline of Human Lifespan: The average lifespan of human beings during Dvapara Yuga decreases compared to Satya Yuga and Treta Yuga. It is believed to be significantly shorter than in the previous ages.<br>

  Dvapara Yuga represents a transitional period between the more virtuous ages of Satya Yuga and Treta Yuga and the subsequent age of Kali Yuga, which is considered an age of darkness and spiritual ignorance. Each yuga is believed to bring its own set of challenges and opportunities for spiritual growth and evolution.<br>
