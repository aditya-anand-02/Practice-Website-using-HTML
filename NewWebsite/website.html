<h2> This is a portal where you can find relevant information related to indian history according to the Hindu yuga calender</h2>
<p>
    In Hindu mythology, the concept of yugas refers to the cycles or epochs that mark different periods of time.
    According to Hindu scriptures, the universe goes through a series of yugas,
    each characterized by different qualities and levels of human civilization.<br>
    According to Hindu beliefs, the yugas follow a cyclical pattern, with each yuga gradually leading to the next in a repeating cycle. At the end of the Kali Yuga, it is believed that the cycle will restart with the Satya Yuga, ushering in a new era of spiritual enlightenment and righteousness.

    Different interpretations and variations exist within Hindu mythology regarding the durations and specific qualities of each yuga.<br>
